## Voice Packages

For now, it has 2 built-in voice package which are Chinese and English edition. In order to avoid the extension being too large, no plan to add more built-in voice. You can find and install voice package of other languages, gender or tone style, etc at [here](https://github.com/topics/rainbow-fart).

The built-in voice package of English edition is created by Speech Synthesis. Because I don't have any friends that use English as mother language, if you are interested in this project, it would be nice to have contribute with your voice, no matter about gender, tone color, personality, language, contry etc.

P.S. The voice of Chinese edition is recorded by real people if you have interests, [take a look](/zh/)
