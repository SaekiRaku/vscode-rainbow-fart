## Summary

**VSCode Rainbow Fart** is an extension that keeps giving you compliment while you are coding. It will check the keywords in your code to play relative sounds.

> Rainbow Fart is a literal translation word from Chinese, which means giving somebody exaggerated compliment that even seems a little fake. It is not connected to any specific group or individuals.
